#This is a sentiment classifier on a fairly small dataset.
# This code adds the incredibly useful scikit learn package
# to your toolkit, which is especially useful for processing text data.
#
# This uses a "naive bayes" classifier instead of a neural net.
# You can add keras to do the classification as an additional challenge
# but the goal here is to improve the 66% validation accuracy to above
# 68%.  One approach is to use TfidfVectorizer instead of CountVectorizer
# and then SGDClassifier instead of naive bayes ("MultinomialNB", but there 
# are many other ways.
#
# Check out examples/scikit for inspiration.
